This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications: intermittent crashes caused by improper handling of asynchronous operations using the fetch API. The original code uses the deprecated method `fetch` without proper error handling or asynchronous management causing random crashes.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly use async/await to handle asynchronous operations and prevent unexpected behavior. This improved handling ensures better stability and prevents app crashes.
